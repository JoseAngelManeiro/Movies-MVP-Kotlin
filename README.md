# mvp-clean-dagger

This version of the app follows [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) to implement UseCases.

### What you need

This project gets the information from [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). If you want to run the project correctly, you will have to use your own **API Key** in the [MoviesRemoteDataSourceImpl](https://github.com/JoseAngelManeiro/Movies-Kotlin/blob/mvp-clean-dagger/app/src/main/kotlin/com/joseangelmaneiro/movies/data/source/remote/MoviesRemoteDataSourceImpl.kt) class.
